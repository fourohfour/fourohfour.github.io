### Welcome to the homepage of FourOhFour
I'm FourOhFour, a programmer and computer science enthusiast from the United Kingdom. My username is derived from the infamous HTTP response code [404 - Not Found](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404). I've been programming since the age of 11, and my enjoyment of writing code has remained unabated since then.
 
### Current Projects
I have recently been working on **[richter](https://github.com/fourohfour/richter)** - a command-line client for the Show My Homework web application written in   the systems programming language Rust.  

I am also working on [RIPL](https://github.com/fourohfour/RIPL) - An experimental imperative programming language designed to be compilable into multiple [esoteric languages](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Main_Page).
          
### Interests

I enjoy studying many fields of computer science and its related subjects. In particular, my interests lie in programming languages. The theory, design, and implementation of programming languages is endlessly fascinating to me. Languages which particuarly interest me currently are the systems programming language Rust and the functional language Haskell. I have dabbled in a multitude of programming lanuages, but I would describe myself as having competency in Python, Rust, C and Java.

Outside of computer science, I enjoy certain aspects of pure mathematics, as well as much of linguistics. The common thread between my academic interests is the study of the comprehension, representation and application of abstract concepts and systems.

I am the programmer for the VEX Robotics team 3117, Shark Robotics. The culmination of our team's success came in 2017 with our winning of the VEX UK National Championships.


I have a long term love for motorsports in all its guises. I currently follow several dozen racing series, with my particular interests being single-seater and sportscar racing. In Formula 1, I support Force India out of admiration for their underdog status. In sportscars, I support McLaren, or whoever Shane Van Gizbergen is driving for.
